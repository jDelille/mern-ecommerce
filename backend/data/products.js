      "By the mid-1970s, Spidey fans could thrill to their favorite hero’s escapades in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, his high-octane encounters with other super-types in MARVEL TEAM-UP, his all-ages adventures in SPIDEY SUPER STORIES and reprints of classic stories in MARVEL TALES – and still it wasn’t enough! Such was the clamor that a second solo title debuted with a focus on the man beneath the mask: the always popular Peter Parker! But fear not, there’s plenty of costumed action in this frantic first issue – and when the deadly Tarantula strikes at Peter’s university, it’s Spidey who feels the sting! Will the Tarantula claim the mayor’s life, or can our wall-crawling Web-Head save the day in suitably spectacular fashion? It’s one of the all-time great Marvel comic books, boldly re-presented in its original form, ads and all! ",
